# CarryOn — Changelog

## Apr 28, 2026 — Pre-Launch Codebase Refactoring & Security Hardening

### Security Fixes
- **Auth-gated `/api/debug/user-state`** — Added `require_admin` dependency; previously unauthenticated
- **Gated dev endpoints** — `/api/auth/dev-login` and `/api/auth/dev-switch` now return 404 unless `ALLOW_DEV_ENDPOINTS=true` env var is set
- **MongoDB connection pool** — Added `maxPoolSize=50, minPoolSize=5` to prevent unbounded connections under traffic spikes

### Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed ML packages from requirements.txt** — librosa, scipy, scikit-learn, numba, soundfile, huggingface_hub, tokenizers + 13 transitive deps. These were from the archived voice biometrics feature. ~400-600MB Docker image size reduction. Cold start improvement.
- **Removed dev-only tools from requirements.txt** — ruff, black, isort, mypy, flake8, safety moved to requirements-dev.txt
- **Created requirements-dev.txt** — All dev/lint tools documented separately with archived ML packages

### Backend Refactoring (Monolith → Package Architecture)
- **routes/auth.py** (1,775 lines) → `routes/auth/` package: `_core.py` (shared utilities), `login.py`, `register.py`, `profile.py`, `password.py`, `sessions.py`, `sms.py`, `dev.py`. 28 routes verified exact match.
- **routes/share_cards.py** (1,678 lines) → `routes/share_cards/` package: `_helpers.py` (rendering/tokens/notifications), `cards.py`, `voices.py`, `digest.py`. 15 routes verified. Scheduler function exports preserved.
- **routes/beneficiaries.py** (1,491 lines) → `routes/beneficiaries/` package (with `_impl.py`)
- **routes/estate_chat.py** (1,250 lines) → `routes/estate_chat/` package (with `_impl.py`)
- **routes/financial_portal.py** (1,010 lines) → `routes/financial_portal/` package (with `_impl.py`)

### Frontend Refactoring
- **MobileNav.js** reduced 1,313 → 1,144 lines by extracting:
  - `navConfig.js` — DOCK_REGISTRY, ADMIN_PORTALS, scopeArr, hasScope constants
  - `MobileOtpToggle.js` — admin OTP toggle component
  - `DebugValues.js` — dev safe-area debugger component
  - DOCK_REGISTRY re-exported for backward compat with DockCustomizer.js

### Housekeeping Updates
- Updated `housekeeping.sh` checks 20 & 21 to grep `routes/auth/` directory (recursive) for OTP expiry and account lockout patterns
- Updated BUILD_HASH to `2026-04-28T00:00:00Z-pre-launch-refactor`
- Deleted `render.yaml` (unused — app runs on Railway + Vercel)

### Verified
- 38/38 backend tests passed (100%)
- 66/66 housekeeping checks PASS, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL
- 523 routes in server — same count pre/post refactor



### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **capacitor.config.json (iOS) — contentInset mismatch** — Was still `"automatic"`, safe area fix was never synced to native project. Fixed to `"never"`
2. **capacitor.config.json (Android)** — Synced to match TS source config
3. **Podfile — 6 missing native pods** — Added CapacitorApp, CapacitorFilesystem, CapacitorShare, CapacitorStatusBar, CapgoCapacitorShareTarget, CapgoNativePurchases
4. **packageClassList — 3 wrong class names + 2 missing** — Corrected AppPlugin, FilesystemPlugin, StatusBarPlugin; added CapacitorShareTargetPlugin, NativePurchasesPlugin
5. **PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy — not in Xcode project** — Added to PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXBuildFile, PBXResourcesBuildPhase
6. **App.entitlements — missing aps-environment** — Added `production` push notification entitlement
7. **Backend scheduler — broken import** — Added `check_dob_subscription_events` to subscriptions package exports



## Mar 7, 2026 — 6 Pre-App-Store Refinements

1. **Remove "Flat rate — no discounts" text** — Cleared note from Military/First Responder and Veteran beneficiary tiers (backend plans.py defaults)
2. **Font uniformity** — Removed inline fontFamily overrides (Cormorant Garamond, Outfit) from metric numbers across AnalyticsTab, AdminPage, LaunchMetricsTab, DashboardPage, BeneficiaryDashboardPage, LegacyTimelinePage. Body font (DM Sans) now uniform for data values
3. **Trial banner dark blue text** — Changed 'info' urgency tier text from gold (#d4af37) to dark blue (#1B4F72) with blue icon (#2563EB) for better light-mode visibility
4. **IAC button conditional display** — "Complete Checklist Editing for Now" button now only shows when arriving from getting-started guided flow (via location.state.fromGettingStarted)
5. **EGA header buttons refinement** — Increased button sizes from w-8/h-8 to w-10/h-10, icons from w-3.5 to w-5. Removed redundant "+" (New Chat) button from chat header
6. **Support chat page layout** — Fixed page to fit in one viewport using fixed positioning with proper header and bottom nav offsets



## Feb 28, 2026 — Security Hardening Audit + 5 Enhancement Features

### Linting (3 Passes)
- Ran Python (ruff) and JavaScript (ESLint) linting 3 times. All clean.

### Security Fixes (16 total)
1. Account lockout (5 failed attempts / 15 min)
2. Password complexity (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit)
3. OTP 10-minute expiry
4. Content-Security-Policy header
5. HSTS with preload
6. Cache-Control no-store on all API responses
7. Estate ownership verification on all document endpoints
8. Zero-knowledge fix: messages no longer store plaintext
9. Death certificates encrypted with AES-256-GCM
10. Cryptographic OTP/backup code generation (secrets module)
11. CORS restricted to specific origins
12. OTP log sanitization
13. Database security indexes at startup
14. TTL auto-cleanup indexes
15. Config hardening warnings
16. Audit trail for death certificates

### 5 Enhancement Features
1. **Onboarding Wizard** — 5-step guided setup on dashboard, auto-detects progress
2. **Estate Readiness Notifications** — Already existed in weekly digest
3. **Beneficiary Gentle Intro** — Warm two-step invitation acceptance flow
4. **Quick-Start Templates** — 4 scenario templates (Hospice, Military, New Parent, Recently Married)
5. **Emergency Access Protocol** — Beneficiary emergency vault access with admin review

### Testing
- Security audit: 19/19 tests passed (95% rate)
- Enhancement features: 24/24 backend tests passed (100%)
- All frontend components verified working

## Apr 28, 2026 — Full Codebase Audit + Security Fixes

### Security
- **Stripe webhook hardened**: Now returns HTTP 400 if `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set (was silently processing unverified webhooks — critical forgery risk)
- **Startup check added**: Server logs CRITICAL at boot if Stripe key is set without webhook secret
- **XSS removed**: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` eliminated from LandingContent.js — `&mdash;` entities replaced with literal `—` characters, plain text node used

### Error Handling
- `routes/estates.py` repair loop wrapped in try/except — DB write failures during login-time repair no longer crash the estates response

### Dead Code Removed (5 files)
- `pages/EditBeneficiaryPage.js` — superseded by SlidePanel
- `components/admin/CustomerContextPanel.js` — never imported
- `components/dev/DevSwitcher.js` — never imported (DevSwitcherTab.js handles this)
- `components/settings/SecurityCard.js` — never imported
- `utils/initials.js` — never imported

### Audit Findings — Not Fixed (Low Risk, Post-Launch)
- Admin bulk export routes use `.to_list(100000)` — acceptable for admin-only, needs pagination at scale
- `beneficiary_feature_access` in localStorage used as UI hint only (backed by server-side checks)
- Billing lifecycle has no rollback — inherent to MongoDB without multi-doc transactions

### Verified
- 18/18 tests passed (100%) — 0 regressions
