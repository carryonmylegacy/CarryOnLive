# CarryOn™ — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
CarryOn is a secure, AI-powered estate planning platform for American families. It helps users organize critical end-of-life documents, milestone messages, and digital asset credentials, encrypted and stored securely for beneficiaries to access when the time comes.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 (CRA via Craco) + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI — 32 pages, 74 components, 65 packages
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11) — 170 endpoints, 26 route modules, 7 services, modular architecture
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (production) / local MongoDB (preview) — 35 collections
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (carryon-vault, us-east-2)
- **AI**: xAI Grok-4 (Estate Guardian AI)
- **Payments**: Stripe (checkout, subscriptions, proration)
- **Email**: Resend (OTP, notifications, digests)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor 6 → Codemagic → TestFlight
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (lint + build)
